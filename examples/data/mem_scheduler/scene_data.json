My parents were always busy, and I often felt like I had to figure things out on my own. I remember one winter, I got really sick with a high fever. My parents were both working, and I didn't want to bother them. I just lay in bed, crying by myself, not knowing what to do."

      "content": "Yeah, it was really lonely. I remember spending a lot of time doing things on my own, like drawing, because it was my only way to escape.

      "content": "Relaxation techniques like deep breathing and meditation can help reduce stress, but sometimes we need a more structured approach to improve both our physical and mental state. For example, you might want to focus on specific aspects of your tennis training, or adjust your rest and recovery time. Have you thought about setting smaller goals for yourself? Like focusing on a specific tennis move each day, rather than expecting perfection right away? That might help you gradually regain confidence."

      "content": "Exactly! Setting small and clear goals will help reduce pressure and give you a sense of accomplishment.
